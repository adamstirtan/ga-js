# Genetic Algorithm (GA) Visualization

This repository contains a web application that visualizes Genetic Algorthms (GA) for solving the traveling salesman problem. The application uses HTML and JavaScript to create an interactive demonstration of how a chromosome can be encoded to find a short path through a number of locations exactly once.

## Demo

To see the GA visualization in action, you can visit the live demo at [https://adamstirtan.github.io/ga-js/](https://adamstirtan.github.io/ga-js/).

## Features

- Genetic algorithm visualization.
- Canvas based TSP drawing
- Dynamic control of GA hyperparameters (Crossover and mutation rate) as sliders

## Using the Experiment

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamstirtan/ga-js.git
   ```

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Interact with the GA visualization using the parameters.
